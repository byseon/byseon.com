# SEON

I build systems for speech, intelligence, and human communication.

## What I work on

- **Pronunciation assessment** — scoring and feedback systems for language learners
- **ASR** — automatic speech recognition pipelines and optimization
- **Voice agents** — conversational AI that speaks and listens
- **Applied ML** — research that becomes real, deployed tools

## Approach

I care about systems that work in production, not just in notebooks.
Most of my work sits at the intersection of speech processing, ML infrastructure, and product.

## Beyond code

I write, record, mix, master, and release music.
I document life through photography.
