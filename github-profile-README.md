# SEON

I build systems for speech, intelligence, and human communication.

Pronunciation, ASR, voice agents, applied ML — my work sits between linguistics and machine learning. I think about how people actually speak, how they pick up new languages, where things break. Then I build around that.

I write, record, and release music. I take photos.
